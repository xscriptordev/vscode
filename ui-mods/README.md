# UI Mods 

These mods modify the VS Code interface through JS and CSS injection.  
To install them, it is absolutely necessary to have the **Custom UI Style** extension installed.  

*Previews*:

In the [styles](./styles) folder you will find the following files:

- [settings.json](./styles/settings.json): this is an example of how your profile configuration file could look. Modify it as needed (I’ve added the use of VS Code animations since I use them regularly).  

- [rounded.css](./styles/rounded.css): adds rounded borders to the VS Code interface.  

- [quickcenter.css](./styles/quickcenter.css) and [quickcenter.json](./styles/quickcenter.json): control the position of the quick options when pressing `Ctrl + P` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` in VS Code.
